<p>You are working with a DataFrame <code class="java">df_rock</code> that contains sonar signals from two object classes: rocks and mines. In the first five columns, you can see wavelengths that got the sonar from different angles.</p>
<p>Load the given data as a <code class="java">pandas</code> DataFrame, then count the median of the <code class="java">null_deg</code> column for rock <code class="java">"R"</code> and for mine <code class="java">"M"</code> objects separately. Below you can see the output sample. Remember to round your answer to <strong>three decimal places.</strong></p>
<p><b>Tip:</b>  Please, check the format of your answer, it must be "M = value R = value". </p>
