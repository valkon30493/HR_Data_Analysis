<h2>Get odd numbers from a list</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>There is a list containing numbers which are equal to their indexes in the list:</p>
<p> </p>
<pre><code class="java">nums = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]</code></pre>
<p> </p>
<p>Select <strong>all suitable ways</strong> to get a list containing only odd numbers from this list in any order.</p>
<p>[HINT]As you remember, the full syntax for slicing look like this: <code class="java">sequence[start:stop:step]</code>. So, if there are two colons between the numbers it means that the stop index is not specified.[/HINT]</p>
</div>
